# UltraMap

A tracking tool for [Ultrakill Randomizers](https://github.com/TRPG0/ArchipelagoULTRAKILL), available at https://ultramap.catalyst4.dev.

## How do I use it?
Click on a level to mark it as unlocked. Once a level is unlocked, click on any box to toggle it between unchecked or checked (or perfected for level ranks). The borders around boxes show if the check is possible with your current arsenal.

To manage your arsenal, click the Arsenal tab and check whichever weapons, alternates, arms, and movement you have unlocked.

Settings can be changed under the settings tab. Currently, only settings affecting the randomizer items are shown. There are plans to import settings from YAML files, and automatically sync with Archipelago sessions.


## Something isn't working!
If you have any issues with the website, make an [issue](https://github.com/Catalyst4222/UltraMap/issues) or DM the author (`catalyst4`) on discord.
